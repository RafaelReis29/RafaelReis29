# ✨ Welcome, I'm Rafael Reis

Curious, creative, dedicated and passionate about systems and the use of logic as a tool for human transformation. 

I'm a programming student with a focus on Salesforce development, currently preparing for my first internship in the field. I already have the Salesforce AI Associate certification and I´m continuing to expand my knowledge of systems architecture, automation and logic applied to real scenarios.

I have a strong interest in the complexity of systems and how they shape people's experience, which makes me see each process as a structure to be understood, organized and improved - always with a focus on clarity, performance and purpose.

I bring with me a mindset of constant learning, personal discipline (structured in my own organizational system at Notion) and an analytical approach focused on results. I'm attracted to companies that value the intersection between technology, strategy and human relations - and it's in this scenario that I want to grow and make an impact.
